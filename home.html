      <h4>Get Started</h4>
      <p>A learning and development strategy known as STEM incorporates the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Students learn crucial competencies such as problem-solving, creativity, critical analysis, teamwork, independent thinking, initiative, communication, and digital literacy through STEM (Government of Western Australia, n.d). Additionally, this strand encourages students to learn by engagement in projects that have real-world applications. This method enables pupils to participate actively while learning (Lutkevich, 2022). STEM helps students build strong work ethics, prepares them for careers, and creates professionals. It also includes a wide variety of experiences and abilities. A well-rounded education benefits greatly from each STEM component. Learners who study science gain a thorough awareness of their surroundings. It aids in their development of critical thinking and research skills. Young people are more equipped to operate in a high-tech workplace thanks to technology. Students can develop their problem-solving abilities and apply their knowledge to new tasks by studying engineering. People can use mathematics to examine information, fix mistakes, and consciously choose solutions (Study in the USA, 2021). Overall, STEM equips people with the abilities to prosper and adapt to this rapidly changing world. the right place.</p>

                                    <p>During my final year in junior high, choosing a strand wasn't too tough for me as I have already made up my mind to take STEM. I did so for three main reasons. First, it was aligned to what I want to pursue in the future. I have always dreamt of being a successful doctor, and taking STEM would be the best choice. Second, I was part of the STE program during my junior high times. Since I have graduated junior high school in that program, continuing it and taking STEM is recommended by my teachers. It would be a great choice as I would have prior knowledge about the possible lessons we will be taking. Lastly, my family suggested STEM if I was still unsure and undecided. STEM careers are consistently in demand, there are a variety of work options available especially in the Philippines. Hence, taking the STEM strand would be the best course of action. I know I'll face a lot of challenges in the future as a result of choosing this path. However, I've already overcome some of them so I believe I am braver and stronger now to be able to handle problems in the future. If I can accomplish it, I'm sure you can too. Take the STEM strand with me.</p>

                                    <p>Being a former STE student, it is actually not surprising that I am taking this strand. I must admit, however, that I wasn't certain beforehand which strand I ought to pursue. But when our research teacher said before that the STE Program would become meaningless and nonsense if we did not continue on the track it offers, I realized at that point that I should choose STEM as my strand. And as I was considering what our teacher had said before, I came to the realization that the course I wanted to take in college fit into this strand, which is Engineering. My creativity and 21st-century skills were developed when I entered the STEM field. Media and technology literacy, productivity, social skills, communication, adaptability, and initiative are examples of 21st-century skills. Additionally, as we are starting face-to-face sessions again, it develop time management skills that I needed, my communication skills, and critical thinking.</p>

                                    <p>To be honest, choosing STEM strand wasn’t my first choice. So, I did my research about this strand and looked up for the possible career and courses it offers. Some people would say that STEM strand is full of mathematical equations, endlessly solving of numbers, and logical questions. I guarantee you, it’s more than that. The experiences and moments you will have are unexplainable and will surely be part of your journey. So, why STEM? Honestly speaking, I still have no answers to that question yet. I feel like I’m still in the process of acknowledging why I am here. But I know, throughout this journey here in STEM strand I will be able to identify what my inner self seeks and wants and If I were going to give you some advice, it is okay to take your time searching for answers, because you’ll eventually find it along the process.</p>

                                    <p>As a former STE student in junior high, I continue the journey that I've started. I'm amazed at how my studies and knowledge have been so broad since I was a junior, and it still amazes me today that I chose STEM. This strand helps me prepare myself for my next step in college; it opens my mind to mostly science and mathematics subjects. Since the path that I'm taking is in the medical field, this strand is a big advantage. I'm afraid of failing, so I strive harder for as long as I can. Work hard, then rest after. Your present self decides what your future self will be.</p>

                                    <p>Growing up, I've always shown interest and fascination in math and science, regardless of how bad I was in those subjects. And I never once gave a thought about what I wanted to be in the future; that is, until one of my cousin shared her dreams of becoming a civil engineer and how she'll be picking the STEM strand in SHS. She explained to me how STEM was a strand for people who are aspiring to be future engineers, doctors, scientists, etc. I was inspired by her goals and decided to become an engineer in the future, as well. Fast forward -- 2 years later, here I am in STEM. A semester has passed, and this strand has certainly shaped me into a better and smarter student. The amount of challenges that STEM has thrown at me was overwhelming, but in the end, I made it. Here's what I've got to say for those who are afraid of taking this strand — don't be intimidated by the immense pressure that STEM will give you; pressure makes diamonds, after all.</p>

                                    <p>As a student during my junior high school year i have been interested in technology i often watch tech videos to learn more about a specific gadget like a phone or laptops my interest in technology grew more and more as time goes by during my last year in junior high i had to choose a strand that i need to take for the next chapter of my life since i have a habit of finding out whats inside of a gadget and how it works i decided that i wanted to be a mechanical engineer so i choose STEM for my strand which provided me with the knowledge i will need for college like Math, Science, English and etc. These 3 core subjects is very important when applying for a university in college and STEM will provide it for you since STEM offers you to learn and enhance your knowledge when it comes to these 3 core subject perfect for any course in college</p>

                                    <p>What are my realizations as a STEM student before and during the school year?
                                    When I was in 10th grade, choosing my strand was a difficult task. It was stressful knowing that my future career is quite irrelevant to the existing strands at my school. However, some people convinced me that enrolling in STEM will provide me with numerous opportunities, particularly in selecting a college major. STEM can help you develop logical and critical reasoning skills, which will help you come up with potential solutions to real-life problems. This also aids in understanding why and how things work and were created, which is one of the things that pique my curiosity in learning. The exhaustion of being a STEM student is undeniable. Despite the hardships and sacrifices that I must make, in the end, this will be a privilege for me to achieve my goals, as well as a considerable advantage for the world's future.</p>

                                    <p>I enjoy math but am not particularly good at it, so I chose the STEM strand. You will develop an interest in it and pursue your desired career. I'm in this strand because it corresponds to a course I'd like to take in college. I like it because I like learning new and interesting things. The best advice I can give to people looking for STEM strands is to be certain about their decision because STEM is all about analysis and nothing in life is easy.</p>

                                    <p>I chose the STEM strand because I want to be a nurse someday and to be more educated and fully understand the importance of mathematics in our daily life. I want to take the risk to conquer my own flaws and eventually turn it into my strength. The other factor that urged me to choose this strand, is that I want to expand my learning about how our surroundings work according to their purposes. I am seeking accurate answers to generate better questions. In conclusion, choose this strand to learn more and do more. one of the biggest advantages of the STEM strand rests in its capacity is to set up students for success by preparing them for some of the most demanding yet fulfilling careers in society. Being a STEM student is challenging, I advise, being a STEM student is not just about being smart, it is about how determined you are in the track you've chosen. Ignore all the negative feelings and just enjoy.</p>

                                    <p>I am a STEM Student at San Jose National High school. I chose STEM because the path or course that I wanted to take is in the Stem Strand aside from that choosing Stem will help me improve, learn and enhance my skills about the course that im planning to take. To my fellow students that are planning to take the Stem Strand I would like to advice that Stem can be hard, all kinds of strands but in order to achieve your goals in life you need to be hard working student and make sure to make a schedule in order for you to avoid getting pressure, And lastly is to enjoy learning with your friends and classmates!</p>

                                    <p>Before I graduated from junior high school, I'm still uncertain on what track I should be taking. I've always wondered what I wanted to do because I still didn't know anything about it. But at some point STEM track occurs to me which meant a great opportunity for me. The doubts, fear and what if's are always there but once you became part of STEM family (STEMWARD) you don't feel those things anymore rather it will help you grow and teach you a lesson you'll take through out your journey in life, it will outcast your precious achievement and become the better version of you. I am Milkee Charm Benitado a STEM student who will leave a mark "An Opportunities that knock on your door holds a better future".</p>

                                    <p>Before I started my Senior High School journey, I was hesitant which strand to choose. So, why STEM? STEM strand offers a lot of possible courses and they said it has a higher privilege if you want to enter prestigious universities but that's not what I'm after. I chose STEM because it is aligned with the future career that I want to achieve. So far, being a STEM student made me realized that this strand is more than what it seems. Despite the stressful nights, endlessly solving mathematical equations, and tiresome weekdays, it’s more than that. I’ve met amazing people with prosperous ambitions just like mine. I’ve learned a lot of things that I could apply in my life. I was anxious entering this strand because my mind is full of what ifs. What if this strand is not meant for me? What if mid-way of the semester, I end up not liking the process of learning? But I did not regret choosing this strand. As a STEM student, I advise everyone to prepare themselves to all hardcore subjects because it’s not easy as it seems especially if some of the areas of the subject is not your forte. Do some advance review of the future topics and be ready. When you’re in doubt of yourself, remember why you’re here today. Look back to all the hardships you’ve been through and how you overcome them. Because, “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”</p>

                                    <p>Before I finished grade 10, I was having a lot of trouble with the strand I was going to take, I was thinking about what I should really take, whether I should study stem or ict, so I thought and asked myself what the my passion and what are the things that make me happy and here I have decided that I should study stem because one of my passions is to give myself plenty of trouble to learn more and another since childhood I really want to math and science, that's one of the reasons why I became a stem student. It's also one of my dreams to become an electrical engineer because I also saw potential in myself in fiddling with electric things. It's also one of my passions and I'm happy. me because everything I did not expect in this strand has come true, I have been faced with many challenges and I have also learned a lot that I have wanted to know for a long time and I am Renzo Chavez Ilao who is very happy because it is an honor to share my experience in STEM.</p>

                    Upon entering STEM many would face difficulties, but it's not that bad. There are students in STEM that achieve something as they progress and graduate from the STEM strand. Here are some achievements that STEM students achieve by taking on the challenge of the STEM strand. 
                    <br><br>
                    For me, I observed in myself that, even though it's still not that good, being a STEM student has improved my Math and critical thinking skills. I would say that it may, and will be hard at times, but the self-growth that you will observe will be well worth it.
                    Matthew Rona - G11 STEM

                    STEM helped students improve their overall performance, whether it'd be performing task, completing assignments or homeworks, conducting a research, participating in activities.
                    <br><br>
                    Visible growth in one person is achieved within STEM, due to the particular reason of the challenging subjects that will slowly improve a student thinking ability, decision making.
                    Edward Moran - G11 STEM 
                    <br><br>
                    Upon entering STEM, I was able to achieve a better version of myself. I became more eager to learn, more braver and stronger to face future challenges, and developed numerous skills and talents. Therefore, STEM shaped me into who I am today in which I am proud of.

                  <div class="collapsible-body white"><span>Students are more likely to enroll in STEM courses in college and potentially choose to work in related professions if they receive better STEM education before that point. In addition, they'll be more assured about their academic endeavors in general and far less inclined to quit.

                    We must admit that, as Grade 11 STEM students, what we are going through right now is really different from what we were thinking while we were still in junior high school. We encountered several new acquaintances and students, all of whom had unique personalities and traits. When it comes to the activities and performance tasks that I must complete, being a STEM student makes us more patient and responsible. 
                    <br><br>
                    For STEM students to successfully complete their given duties, they must be very persistent and determined. They need knowledge and may result in difficulties and challenges in life, but such issues fortify us and have a significant influence on our lives as well as our academic performance. 
                    <br><br>
                    We often say that before achieving our goals, we must go through many hardships in life. The STEM experience will be beneficial because it will allow you to learn more about the topics covered and even help you find a stable job in the future. It will also teach you the importance of helping others and the idea that we shouldn't let ourselves or those around us fall behind but rather should be the catalyst for their ascent as well. 
                    <br><br>
                    Being a STEM student takes a lot of work, perseverance, and devotion. But underneath all of this, there are a ton of special moments and adventures that add to the excitement of our Grade 11 experience.
                    <br><br>
                    In high school, as a STEM student, I discovered the value of projects and homework. I also developed a sense of community, learned how to apply what I had learned, and mentored other STEM students as a result of the excruciating amount of homework. Because you all work together to graduate and attend college, the STEM students have connected like bees in a hive. The coursework was occasionally very challenging, especially during my freshman year. Of course, most STEM students, including me, were under stress. For instance, in computer science, neither I nor anybody else in my class knew how to write the code for our project. I was able to finish the project because a friend who had previously taken the course was able to explain how to write the code.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to the difficulty of our subjects and the effort required to pass them, it encourages me to study more seriously. My experience as a grade 11 student was made more difficult by certain topics, such as Statistics and Probability, General Chemistry, and Basic Calculus.
                    <br><br>
                    It takes a lot of work, perseverance, and dedication to be a STEM student. But behind all of these, there are a ton of special moments and adventures that have made my time as a grade 11 student more interesting overall.
